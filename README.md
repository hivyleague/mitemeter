## Mitemeter

The mitemeter is a simple device to simply and efficiently perform varroa mite counts in honeybee colonies.


### Capturing bee samples with a vacuum

The first step when counting mites is to capture a sample of live bees. We suggest using a handheld vacuum and this repository provides models for a 3d-printed adapter to the popular Ryobi hand vac R18HV-0.

The adapter is made of 4 components, which each should be 3d-printable in one shot with a FDM machine:

* stl/foundation.stl: this part clips on the vacuum
* stl/pipe.stl: this part slides in the foundation and provides the nozzle as well as a mesh screen
* stl/box_attachment.stl: this part is attached to the pipe with a M4 screw and can be glued as well for air tightness
* stl/clip.stl: you would need 3 of them and they clip ot the box_attachment

### The sample cups

We use conical cups with a 3d printed rim that screws into the box attachment
